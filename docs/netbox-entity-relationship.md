# Netbox Entity Relationships

![Entity Relationship Render](docs/images/entity-relationship-render.png)

NetBox is a leading open-source web application for network infrastructure management and documentation, providing advanced features for IP address management (IPAM) and data center infrastructure management (DCIM), along with robust APIs and extensions for network automation. Built on top of Django, it leverages a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system to allow developers to interact with databases using Python code, providing a high level of abstraction and ease of use.

An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is an essential tool for developers to visualize and ensure proper database schema structure, and Opticore's newly released NetBox plugin facilitates ERD creation for any NetBox model.
