For example, if an order can have multiple products and a product can belong to multiple orders, we would use a diamond-shaped arrow to represent this relationship.</li> <li>Dot: The dot shape represents an optional relationship. It indicates that the existence of one entity is not dependent on the existence of another entity. For example, if a customer may or may not have an order, we would use a dot-shaped arrow to represent this relationship.</li> <li>Icurve: The Icurve shape represents a self-referencing relationship, where an entity is related to itself. For example, if an employee has a supervisor who is also an employee, we would use an Icurve-shaped arrow to represent this relationship.</li> <li>Inv: The Inv shape represents a one-to-one relationship between two entities. It indicates that one entity is associated with one and only one instance of another entity. For example, if a person has only one social security number and a social security number is associated with only one person, we would use an Inv-shaped arrow to represent this relationship.</li> <li>Tee: The Tee shape represents a one-to-many relationship between two entities. It indicates that one entity is associated with many instances of another entity. For example, if a customer can have multiple orders, we would use a Tee-shaped arrow to represent this relationship.</li> <li>Vee: The Vee shape represents a disjoint subtypes relationship. It indicates that an entity can belong to one of several possible subtypes, but not more than one at a time.
